# PutativeQTLmapper ðŸ§¬

An interactive **Shiny app** for visualizing *putative QTLs* identified from **GWAS** results.  
This tool integrates TASSEL-like outputs (p-values, RÂ², models) with published marker position data to create **genetic (cM)** and **physical (Mb)** QTL distribution maps.

---

## ðŸ§  Features

- Upload TASSEL GWAS outputs or manually enter data  
- Automatically generate **QTL maps** based on genetic (cM) and physical (Mb) positions  
- Highlight significant loci with `-log10(p)` marker sizing  
- Supports multiple traits and models (GLM / MLM)  
- Download combined high-resolution QTL maps  
- Includes dummy data for demonstration
